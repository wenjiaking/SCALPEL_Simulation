Step 3 of SCALPEL

SUMMARY
We began with 102 dictionary elements, and all of these were included in the sparse group lasso model. The sparse group lasso was fit with lambda=0.1276 and alpha=0.9, and there were 102 neurons with non-zero temporal components (i.e., the neuron was estimated to be active in at least one frame).

ARGUMENTS USED
Method to choose lambda: Training/validation set
User-supplied lambda value: N/A
Value of alpha: 0.9
Minimum cluster size for dictionary element to be included in the sparse group lasso: 1
Should spatial components on the border of the video be included in the sparse group lasso? Yes
Indices of dictionary elements to exclude from the sparse group lasso: N/A
